Taichi THREE is an extension library of the [Taichi Programming Language](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) to render 3D scenes into nice-looking 2D images in real-time (work in progress).
This project is based on [Taichi Three](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi_three), and could render 3D objects with texture.
